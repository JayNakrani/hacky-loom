## Demo

[![quick demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nZNEOm0W8s0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZNEOm0W8s0)

## How to use

1. Visit [JayNakrani.com/hacky-loom](https://JayNakrani.com/hacky-loom)
1. Give camera permission, and then click "Start / Stop" button to start the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode.
1. Position the newly created PiP window wherever you want.
1. Record your screen using your OS's built-in screen recording tool.
1. Share the recordings with others however you'd like.
1. When you're done, either close the window or click "Start / Stop" button to stop the PiP mode.

## How does it work?

It uses the [Picture-in-Picture (PiP)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture) mode
of Chrome to create a floating window that you can move around and resize. The actual screen recording can be done by
the screen recorder of your choice (including the built-in screen recorder of your OS).
